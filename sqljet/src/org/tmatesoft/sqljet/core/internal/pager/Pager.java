     * The page cache as a whole is always in one of the following states:
     * 
     * PAGER_UNLOCK The page cache is not currently reading or writing the
     * database file. There is no data held in memory. This is the initial
     * state.
     * 
     * PAGER_SHARED The page cache is reading the database. Writing is not
     * permitted. There can be multiple readers accessing the same database file
     * at the same time.
     * 
     * PAGER_RESERVED This process has reserved the database for writing but has
     * not yet made any changes. Only one process at a time can reserve the
     * database. The original database file has not been modified so other
     * processes may still be reading the on-disk database file.
     * 
     * PAGER_EXCLUSIVE The page cache is writing the database. Access is
     * exclusive. No other processes or threads can be reading or writing while
     * one process is writing.
     * 
     * PAGER_SYNCED The pager moves to this state from PAGER_EXCLUSIVE after all
     * dirty pages have been written to the database file and the file has been
     * synced to disk. All that remains to do is to remove or truncate the
     * journal file and the transaction will be committed.
     * 
     * The page cache comes up in PAGER_UNLOCK. The first time a
     * sqlite3PagerGet() occurs, the state transitions to PAGER_SHARED. After
     * all pages have been released using sqlite_page_unref(), the state
     * transitions back to PAGER_UNLOCK. The first time that sqlite3PagerWrite()
     * is called, the state transitions to PAGER_RESERVED. (Note that
     * sqlite3PagerWrite() can only be called on an outstanding page which means
     * that the pager must be in PAGER_SHARED before it transitions to
     * PAGER_RESERVED.) PAGER_RESERVED means that there is an open rollback
     * journal. The transition to PAGER_EXCLUSIVE occurs before any changes are
     * made to the database file, though writes to the rollback journal occurs
     * with just PAGER_RESERVED. After an sqlite3PagerRollback() or
     * sqlite3PagerCommitPhaseTwo(), the state can go back to PAGER_SHARED, or
     * it can stay at PAGER_EXCLUSIVE if we are in exclusive access mode.

     * Journal files begin with the following magic string. The data was

     * 
     * Since version 2.8.0, the journal format contains additional sanity
     * checking information. If the power fails while the journal is begin
     * written, semi-random garbage data might appear in the journal file after
     * power is restored. If an attempt is then made to roll the journal back,
     * the database could be corrupted. The additional sanity checking data is
     * an attempt to discover the garbage in the journal and ignore it.
     * 
     * The sanity checking information for the new journal format consists of a
     * 32-bit checksum on each page of data. The checksum covers both the page
     * number and the pPager->pageSize bytes of data for the page. This cksum is
     * initialized to a 32-bit random value that appears in the journal file
     * right after the header. The random initializer is important, because
     * garbage data that appears at the end of a journal is likely data that was
     * once in other files that have now been deleted. If the garbage data came
     * from an obsolete journal file, the checksums might be correct. But by
     * initializing the checksum to random value which is different for every
     * journal, we minimize that risk.
